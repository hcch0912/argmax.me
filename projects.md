#### Reinforcement Learning in Game Intelligence 
*2017.10- 2018.9, UCL*

- Researched on intent aware multi-agent reinforcement learning and proposed Trust Region and Implicit Intent Inference in multi-agent reinforcement learning(TRI3) algorithm. The test results on grid games outperformed MADDPG for 5% in average.   <a href="https://github.com/hcch0912/my_trpo_i3"> Code </a>

- Researched on multi-task reinforcement learning, implemented skill-embedding reinforcement learning architecture for StartCraftII with A2C algorithm 

- Implemented an UNO(card game) reinforcement learning agent using DQN, collaborated with EaseNet AI lab and Peking University. 

- Implemented Monte Carlo Tree Search (used by AlphaGo, DeepMind) algorithms for creating agents in a real-time strategy game, similar to Legacy of Legend (LOL), and implemented self-play for training the agents.
