<h4> Reinforcement Learning in Game Intelligence
    <h5> 2017.10- 2018.9, UCL</h5>
</h4>
<p> • Researched on intent aware multi-agent reinforcement learning and proposed Trust Region and Implicit Intent Inference in multi-agent reinforcement learning(TRI3) algorithm. The test results on grid games <b>outperformed MADDPG for 5% in average </b>.
    <a href="https://github.com/hcch0912/my_trpo_i3"> Code </a>
    <br> • Researched on multi-task reinforcement learning, implemented skill-embedding reinforcement learning architecture for StartCraftII with A2C algorithm
    <br> • Implemented an UNO(card game) reinforcement learning agent using DQN, collaborated with EaseNet AI lab and Peking University.
    <br> • Implemented Monte Carlo Tree Search (used by AlphaGo, DeepMind) algorithms for creating agents in a real-time strategy game, similar to Legacy of Legend (LOL), and implemented self-play for training the agents.
