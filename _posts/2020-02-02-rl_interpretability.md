title: Reinforcement Learning Interpretability 
tags: RL

*Deep reinforcement learning is one subject of machine learning, so it also faces the challenge of interpretability. "Why does the agent choose this action/policy instead of the others?" is the question that most of the people would like to ask. For me, as a researcher in this field, I also would like to know how to interprete the behavior of RL agents. Therefore, I created the slides to present the findings of mine. I listed several different approchaes of interpreting the learning of reinforcement learning agents. If you have any questions and advice to share, please contact me.*
